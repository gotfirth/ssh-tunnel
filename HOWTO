Create a free Cloudflare account by going to https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up and signing up for an account.

Once you have an account (and have set up 2FA, hopefully), add a domain name you control to your account by clicking `+Add a Site` on your account dashboard.

You will be required to change your nameservers to the ones provided by Cloudflare if you use another registrar. The steps to do this will be a bit different for each registrar so look for something that says "DNS" or "Name Servers" on the registrar dashboard.

Once you have validated your domain name and are ready to get rocking and rolling, the real fun starts!

You will need to install `cloudflared` on each system (to include the one you will use to access the remote systems).
